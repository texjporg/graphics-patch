    Package graphics/graphicx not loaded!}\@ehc
  \expandafter\endinput
\fi

% check version of graphics-def
% if earlier than 2017/06/01, exit silently as unnecessary

  % make sure all package options are silently ignored, not an error
  \DeclareOption*{\relax}\ProcessOptions\relax
  \endinput}

% now, we append patches

% 1. Improve the behavior of graphics-def
%    This section is always effective when graphics-def 2017/06/01 or later
%    is used, by simply \usepackage{graphics-patch}

% add 'pagebox=none' for convenience
      \let\Gin@pagebox@none\@empty

% 2. Restore backward compatibility of graphics-def behavior
%    This section becomes effective only when package options are given

% use default pagebox determined by engines itself
% this recovers old behavior of dvipdfmx.def, which might be useful
% for processing old documents assuming that old behavior
\DeclareOption{oldpagebox}{\let\Gin@pagebox\@empty}
\ProcessOptions\relax

% all done
\endinput
